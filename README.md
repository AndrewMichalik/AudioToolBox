Audio ToolBox

As a developer, you probably run into many situations where you would like to improve the quality of the audio. Over the past ten years, our customers have asked for tools to record, edit and review prompts with any audio system, improve the way they produce voice prompts, and simplify maintenance of their current systems.

We’ve assembled a set of tools that make it easier for you to do just that. We’ve made these utilities small and fast, since most voice developers work with a large number of files. We’ve made these tools run unattended since many developers need to bulk process their existing messages. We’ve tried to provide sophisticated processing options with a simple user interface to make it all work together.

You decide. For a risk free test drive, download our "Working Demo". We think you’ll like it!
